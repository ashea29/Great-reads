# Project Overview

Great-Reads

## Project Description

Our project idea was to created a [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) clone.  So we created an app called Great-Reads that has some of the same functionality as Goodreads.  The app opens to the main page where we have all the books.  A user can view each book details on the main page.  They can also create, delete, and update the books.  On the Author page you can view all the books but a certain author and add authors.
